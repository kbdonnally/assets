# Big Title

*Usage of syntax highlighting: [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)*

```
var myObject = {
	hello: 'hi!'
}
```

## Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?

I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? You are the last hope of the universe. I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.

1. And until then, I can never die?
2. But I've never been to the moon!
3. Large bet on myself in round one.

### Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!

Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.

- Shut up and get to the point!
- I'm Santa Claus!
- Bite my shiny metal ass.

Kif might! For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. We're also Santa Claus! Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!

Leela's gonna kill me. We're also Santa Claus! I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Bender, this is Fry's decisionâ€¦ and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.

#### Hi, I'm doing the right thing!

*From Doctor Who:*

> Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.
