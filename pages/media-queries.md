# Header 1 - Title of Blog Post

You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! Did I mention we have comfy chairs? *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! __Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!__ *Heh-haa!* Super squeaky bum time!

* I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!
* Did I mention we have comfy chairs?
* No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

1. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.
2. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.
3. You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?
