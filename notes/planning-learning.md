# Planning Learning

*What I notice that I need to learn on this journey.*

## 1. Forms!

- I don't know shit about forms
- I would like to be able to **style them**, and **accept input and store it**
- Also, would like to be able to do something with that input (**databases**)

## 2. Tables!

- How the fuck to **style a table**? We should learn how

## 3. Custom numbering in lists

- Past #9, the list numbers shift over and make the start of the next number shifted. I do not like this!
- Try with absolute positioning so it doesn't affect your other numbers, plus align the text to the right so that's where the flush line can be
